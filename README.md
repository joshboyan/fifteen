#Minimalist Responsive Framework

This is a modern HTML5, mobile-first framework built with Sass and Gulp on a 12 column responsive grid. The framework boasts all of the modern accesiblility features and tools developers use in builds but none of the style bloat. The only boilerplate styling is normalize.scss, our 12 column responsive grid and basic html5 Sass nesting. 

##Automated Development Tools

-Gulp.js task runner to streamline and automate your workflow.

-Panini templating ensures you _don't repeat yourself_ by creating reusable head, header and footer layouts templates to combine with the pages unique body content.

-BrowserSync Live Reload and device testing built right in.

-Use the lastest ES6 syntax with Babeljs, automatically check quality with jshint then compile, concatenate and minify with uglifyjs.

-Responsive grid built on Sass preprocessor is automatically compiled, concataneted, minified and autprefixed along with your custom styles to support legacy browsers.

-No redundant styles that have to overwritten.

-Minimal file bloat, maximum development power.
